## Development Info

The App was created using React JS and Tailwind CSS. The Pre-existing comments and replies are in "data.json" file and once the App is loaded at first time it saves that data in local storage. After initial reload, whenever you reload the it gets data from local storage and updates local storage data when you add a comment etc... Therefore, your data you added will not go away when you reload. 



The App is one of the coding challenges from https://www.frontendmentor.io/.
